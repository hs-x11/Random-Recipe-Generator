# Random-Recipe-Generator

This website was designed with the specific aim of assisting Muslim users in discovering recipes aligned with Islamic principles, ensuring that the ingredients used are permissible. While it is true that any Muslim can manually make an effort to avoid recipes with non permissible ingredients, I still wanted to create a website that eliminates this concern altogether by exclusively suggesting recipes that strictly adhere to Islamic standards. To achieve this, I developed my own list of recipies from the internet that contain a list of Halal ingredients. The goal of this website is to continuously expand and diversify the collection, providing a comprehensive resource for a wide range of palates.

Happy cooking!
